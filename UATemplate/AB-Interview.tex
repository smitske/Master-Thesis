\chapter{Interview}
\label{appendix:interview}

This appendix contains the questions that were asked to the participants of our experiment.
This interview is mainly for evaluating the positives and negatives of the different models from the side of the users and people that will manage and/or develop these systems.
This as goal to get qualitative on the different models.
The interview takes around 30 minutes and we have written down and recorded the answers given by the participants.

\section{Factual questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Different models have been tested, can you tell us which features you used and were needed to complete the different scenario's? which actions had to be done to complete these scenario's?
    
    \item Were you able to complete all requested actions in the scenario, given the available feature set? Which tasks went well?
   
    \item When using conditions did you prefer adding 1 permission/policy with complex conditions or multiple permissions/policies with simple conditions?
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Opinion questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which model did you prefer using for management in the different scenario's?
    
    \item When would you consider the attribute enhanced role based model to be the better choice over the attribute based model? When would you consider using the attribute based model over the attribute enhanced role based model?
    
    \item What is your view on the knowledge that is needed to use the 2 models effectively? Is there a disparity between the knowledge needed with each model?
    
    \item How clear were the interactions between existing policies/permissions and the newly added ones? Was it always clear what the effects of the additions were?
    
    \item What do you think about the options that are available for constructing conditions?  Would they suffice for the systems you develop? If not what additions could be made?
    
    \item Looking at the permissions and policies, how easy to understand would it be if you were put there as a new administrator for the system?
    
    \item Do you foresee any problems that can arise from using these models in systems that are bigger?
    
    \item Are there any features that you think would benefit the different models? What benefits do they provide? Example of possible features: role hierarchy.
    
    \item Looking at it as a developer, which model would be best to make the users easily understand their access rights? Why do you think this is the case?
    
\end{enumerate}

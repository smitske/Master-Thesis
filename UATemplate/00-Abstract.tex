\chapter*{Abstract}
When creating software as a developer there is a need for a systemic approach for access control.
There are multiple access control models that can be found in literature, making it difficult for developers to decide which model to employ and what benefits using one model has compared to another model.
In this thesis we compare 2 such access control models with a case study, Role based access control enhanced with attributes (AERBAC) and Attribute based access control (ABAC).
We implement both of these models and compare them on different metrics to find the most appropriate one for different situations and goals.
This is tested trough comparing the results of users doing the administration with the different models as well as an interview. 
Out of this gathered data we come to a conclusion on when it is better to use the AERBAC model over the ABAC model and vice versa.

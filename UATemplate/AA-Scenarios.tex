\chapter{Scenario's}
\label{appendix:scenario}
This appendix describes the scenarios we used to test correctness and that the users had to perform as part of studying manageability.
These 2 scenario's are based on an existing application.

\section{Scenario 1}
This scenario has 3 different roles which all have certain privileges to view (get), create (post) or edit (put) different resources. There are also actions that can only be done by a certain role. 
\\
The roles have to be created with the corresponding 3 letter code behind them. A user should be assigned to each role. In case of the admin role (ADM) this is already done since this is a prerequisite to use the system.

\subsection{Forwarder(FWD)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can only view the CTN's they created.
    \item Can add CTNs to the system.
    \item Can edit CTN's if status is edited.
    \item Can view all off the following data: CargoTypes, IncoTerms, Carriers, Currencies, Countries, CTNCities, FreightPaymentTypes, ctnAddresses, ctnTracking, ctnAttachments, ctnCharges, ctnGoods, ctnContainers, TransportTypes, UserCommunication, GoodsClassifications, ContainerTypes, Statuses, Charges, IMOs, Locations.
    \item Can Create all of the following data: UserCommunication, ctnGoods, ctnContainers, ctnAttachments.
    \item Can delete following data: ctnAttachments, ctnContainers, ctnGoods.

    \item Can perform action requestvisa if ctn status is edited or visa corrected.
    \item Can perform action copyctn if ctn status is edited, visa granted, correction granted, visa accepted.
    \item The user SEAFRIGO should be assigned to this role.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent(AGT)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can view all the CTN's associated with forwarders they manage.
    \item Can view all off the following data: ctnAddresses, ctnTracking, ctnAttachments, ctnCharges, ctnGoods, ctnContainers, UserCommunication.
    \item Can Create all of the following data: UserCommunication.
    \item Can perform action approvevisa if ctn status is Requested visa, requested correction or visa pending.
     \item Can perform action refusevisa if ctn status is Requested visa, requested correction or visa pending.
     \item Can perform action suspendvisa if ctn status is Requested visa.
     \item The user AGENTFRANCE should be assigned to this role.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Admin(ADM)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can view all the CTN's.
    \item Can view all off the following data: ctnAddresses, ctnTracking, ctnAttachments, ctnCharges, ctnGoods, ctnContainers, UserCommunication.
     \item Can Create all of the following data: UserCommunication.    
\end{itemize}

\section{Scenario 2}
This scenario also has 3 different roles which all have certain privileges to view (get), create (post) or edit (put) different resources.
There are also actions that can only be done by a certain role.
Some values have to be hidden so they cannot be seen or cannot be edited.
\\
The roles have to be created with the corresponding 3 letter code behind them. A user should be assigned to each role. In case of the admin role (ADM) this is already done since this is a prerequisite to use the system.

\subsection{Forwarder(FWD)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can only see their own User object,  cannot view the fields MarkedForUpdate and Current\_Visa\_Amount.
    \item Can edit User object if it is their own User and the login is the primary login for this User. Cannot edit role, currency, active, country, MarkedForUpdate, Current\_Visa\_Amount, InvoicedToAgent or SupervisedBy.
    \item Can view all languages, countries and currencies.
    \item Can only view its own role.
    \item Can only view LoginMngs associated with their User object.
    \item Can add LoginMngs if they belong to the User object and they are the primary login.
    \item Can edit LoginMngs where OrganisationId is the same as their User and they are the primary login, cannot edit the username, active and primary fields.
    \item The user SEAFRIGO should be assigned to this role.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Agent(AGT)}
